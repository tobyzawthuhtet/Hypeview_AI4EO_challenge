* 'train_gt.csv' & wavelength.csv are given data from AI4EO
* 'X_train.csv' is created by assigning bands ID from loaded data (Notes : Bands ID is therefore the same with tensorshape of (,150))
* 'Dimension_reduced_bands.csv' is created by reducing the total stacked value of 150 to 6 bands.
* 'Index.csv' is created by calculating multiple indexes from 'Dimension_reduced_bands'.
